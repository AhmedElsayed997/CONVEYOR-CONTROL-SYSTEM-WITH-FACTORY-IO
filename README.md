# CONVEYOR-CONTROL-SYSTEM-WITH-FACTORY-IO

## Project Title:
Advanced Conveyor Control System with Status Indications and Object Counter
(Using Siemens S7-300 + Factory I/O)

## Tools Used:
- Simatic Manager (STEP 7) - for PLC programming
- Factory I/O - for 3D real-time industrial simulation
- PLCSIM - for PLC behavior testing
- S7-300 CPU 313C
- Programming Language: LAD (Ladder Logic)
 
## Project Description:
This project simulates an advanced conveyor belt system using Siemens S7-300 PLC and Factory
I/O. The system includes object counting, start/stop logic, and visual status indicators using lamps.
